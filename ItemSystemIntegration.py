"""
SSHD Archipelago - Game Item System Integration

This module provides integration with the sshd-rando backend's item spawning system
to enable proper item-get animations and models instead of direct memory writes.

Key Features:
- Uses game's native give_item() function
- Shows item-get animations (Link holding up item)
- Displays 3D item models
- Plays appropriate jingles/fanfares
- Items appear immediately without stage reload

Architecture:
- Python client writes item ID to memory buffer
- Patched game code monitors buffer via ASM hook
- When item detected, game calls Rust give_item() function
- Buffer cleared when complete, signaling Python to continue

        The Rust static buffer is NOT at a fixed offset from the MOD base address.
        It's allocated in a different memory region (heap/separate segment), so we
        must scan for the magic signature 'AP\x00\x01' to locate it dynamically.
        
        First checks addresses cached by the base-address scan (prescan_results)
        so this is typically instantaneous.  Falls back to a full process scan
        only if the cache missed.

        each candidate is scored by:
          - Zero-byte count in slots 1-15 (real buffer = 60/60 zeros on init)
