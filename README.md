# Skyward Sword HD - Archipelago APWorld

An [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multiworld randomizer integration for **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD**.

## What is this?

This APWorld allows you to play Skyward Sword HD in a multiworld randomizer with other Archipelago-supported games. Items are shuffled across all players in a cooperative experience where finding items in your world may send them to players in completely different games!

## Features

- **800+ Locations**: All chests, closets, NPCs, dungeons, minigames, and more
- **200+ Items**: Progression items, equipment, tablets, keys, consumables
- **Full Logic Support**: Ensures you always have items needed to progress
- **40+ Options**: Customize starting items, logic difficulty, item placement
- **Custom Logos**: Replace title screen with Archipelago branding
- **Standalone Patcher**: Host can generate without the ROM — players patch locally with their own copy
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (maybe, I don't have a device that runs macOS)

## Download

### Pre-built Release (Recommended)
Download the latest release zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/LonLon-Labs/SSHD_APWorld/releases) page. It includes:
- `sshd.apworld` — the Archipelago world file
- `ArchipelagoSSHDClient.exe` — standalone client (no Python needed)
- `ArchipelagoSSHDPatcher.exe` — standalone patcher GUI for generating ROM patches from a lightweight `.apsshd`
- `Skyward Sword HD.yaml` — template YAML for seed generation
- `launch_sshd.bat` — optional convenience launcher (Windows)

### Build from Source
See [Quick Start → Option B](#1-install-the-apworld-and-client) below.

## System Requirements
- **Archipelago**: Version 0.5.0 or higher (Tested with 0.6.6)
- **Emulator**: Ryujinx (Tested on [1.1.1376](https://drive.randomstuff.cc/s/dAX3VyrrTcKoatU))
- **Game**: The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and Update Data (Switch)

> **Note**: The mod seems to be at least partially broken for most people on newer versions like 1.3.3, so an older version like 1.1.1376 is recommended

> **Note**: Python is **not** required for players using the pre-built release. Python is only needed if you are building from source.
> If you are building from source, Python 3.10 or higher is required (Python 3.13.9 is recommended as that is what it was built with)

## Quick Start

You can follow [this video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3bCL_RCDzE) or the written guide below

### 1. Install the APWorld and Client

**Option A: Pre-built Release (Recommended — no Python needed)**

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/LonLon-Labs/SSHD_APWorld/releases) page and:
1. Place `sshd.apworld` in your Archipelago custom_worlds folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\custom_worlds\`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Archipelago/custom_worlds/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Archipelago/custom_worlds/`
2. Place `ArchipelagoSSHDClient.exe` anywhere convenient (e.g. your Desktop or the Archipelago folder)
3. Optionally place `launch_sshd.bat` anywhere (if you placed `ArchipelagoSSHDClient.exe` in the Arhcipelago folder)

That's it — no Python, no pip, no dependencies to install.

**Option B: Build from Source (developers/contributors)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonLon-Labs/SSHD_APWorld.git
cd sshd_apworld
pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
python build_release.py     # Builds both exe and apworld
```
Or to only build the apworld (requires Python + dependencies at runtime):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build_apworld.py
```

### 2. Extract Your Game

You'll need a legally obtained copy of Skyward Sword HD for Nintendo Switch along with the update data.

> **Note**: If you are only hosting (generating the multiworld) and not playing SSHD yourself, you can skip this step. The host does not need the ROM — players will patch locally using their own ROM extract.

1. Extract the RomFS and ExeFS from your game using Ryujinx (MAKE SURE THE UPDATE IS INSTALLED BEFORE EXTRACTING)
2. Extract them to your platform's default location:
   - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\sshd_extract\`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Archipelago/sshd_extract/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Archipelago/sshd_extract/`
3. Create `romfs/` and `exefs/` subdirectories with your extracted files

### 3. Generate Your Seed

#### If You Are the Host (you have the ROM files)

1. Download the [Skyward Sword HD Randomizer](https://github.com/mint-choc-chip-skyblade/sshd-rando/releases/latest)
2. Configure all of your options (don't generate, that is handled by Archipelago)
3. Open SkywardSwordHD.yaml for use as a template
4. Use Method 1 and input the path to your `config.yaml` file (found in the SSHD Rando folder)
5. Change other optional settings
6. Put it in `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\Players`
7. Make sure your ROM is extracted (see [Step 2](#2-extract-your-game))
8. Generate locally using all player yamls
    - Open the Archipelago Launcher and click 'Generate'
    - The outputed file should be in `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\output`
    - The `.apsshd` files will contain the full ROM patches since you have the ROM

#### If You Are NOT the Host (the host doesn't have the ROM files)

The host does **not** need the ROM to generate — the `.apsshd` files will be lightweight (just JSON data, no ROM patches). Each player then patches locally using their own ROM.

**Host steps:**
1. Follow the same steps as above (configure options, create YAML, generate)
2. Generation will succeed even without the ROM extract — the `.apsshd` files will just be smaller
3. Distribute the `.apsshd` files to each player

**Player steps (after receiving your `.apsshd`):**
1. Make sure your ROM is extracted (see [Step 2](#2-extract-your-game))
2. Run `ArchipelagoSSHDPatcher.exe`, select your `.apsshd` file, and click **Patch & Install**
   - Or simply double-click the `.apsshd` file and open it with the Archipelago Launcher — it will auto-detect that patching is needed and run the patcher for you.
3. The patcher will generate the ROM patches using your local ROM extract and install them to Ryujinx automatically

> **Tip**: The patcher also supports a CLI mode for advanced use:
> - `ArchipelagoSSHDPatcher.exe your_file.apsshd --nogui` — run without the GUI
> - `--extract-path <path>` — if your ROM extract is in a non-default location
> - `--no-install` — generate patches without installing to Ryujinx
> - `--save-full-apsshd` — create a full `.apsshd` with ROM patches included (for sharing/archiving)

### 4. Hosting

1. Upload the outputed `.zip` file to [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg)
2. Host locally (ADVANCED - requires port forwarding or everyone being on the same LAN)

### 5. Open Ryujinx
Make sure the mod and 1.0.1 update are enabled and open Skyward Sword HD

You should see the custom Archipelago logo - that means it's working

Get into the game far enough to where you can move Link

### 6. Launch the Client
Double-click `ArchipelagoSSHDClient.exe` (or `launch_sshd.bat`)

If you don't have the exe, launch_sshd.bat will fall back to launching with `python launch_sshd_wrapper.py` (requires python dependencies)

### 7. Play!
> **Note**: WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE `Found SSHD base address` IN THE CLIENT BEFORE PICKING ANYTHING UP
> NOT DOING SO COULD POSSIBLY BREAK IT AND NOT SEND THE ITEM OVER

Items you find are automatically sent to other players and vice-versa!
